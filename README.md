The Seckill is TinyDealâ€™s highly competitive promotion.
Offering a very limited number of hugely discounted items at an appointed time. 
The quantities of seckill deals are very limited and are offered at a first-come-first-serve basis

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
Go can make it beter to handle Seckill. 
In a word,I decide to utilize a common pattern when using Go channels, in order to create a 2-tier channel system,
one for queuing jobs and another to control how many workers operate on the JobQueue concurrently.
